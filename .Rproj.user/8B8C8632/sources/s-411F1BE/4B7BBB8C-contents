This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
filmVotingData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpemartin/course-107-1-programming-for-data-science/master/data/%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E5%B1%86%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F%E6%92%AD%E5%AE%A2%E7%AB%B6%E8%B3%BD%E5%8F%83%E8%B3%BD%E4%BD%9C%E5%93%81%E6%8A%95%E7%A5%A8%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E6%A8%A3%E6%9C%AC%20-%20Sheet1.csv")
library(stringr)
b <- str_c(filmVotingData$`出生西元年月日（驗證本人用）`)
b <- str_sub(filmVotingData$`出生西元年月日（驗證本人用）`,1,4)
b

```

```{r}
aa<-str_split_fixed(filmVotingData$請選擇你最喜歡的影片二部,", ",3)
bb<-str_c(aa)
table(bb)
```

```{r}
fruits <- c(
  "apples and oranges and pears and bananas",
  "pineapples and mangos and guavas")
str_split_fixed(fruits, " and ", 2)
```

```{r}
a<-c("A, B","B, C")
a
str_split_fixed(a,", ", n=3)->b
str_c(b)->c

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
